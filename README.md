# SweatStake
ChatGPT called it "SweatStake". It's a fitness app that tracks which days you don't work out with your Apple Health workout data and charges you.

## Customization
You can customize the penalty amount for missing a workout and specify how many break days you want each week.
## Streaks
The app calculates and stores your workout streaks. It considers early morning workouts and provides you with a clear view of how many consecutive days you've worked out.
## Month-by-Month Views
SweatStake offers a month-by-month view of your workout history. You can see which months you've been consistent and where you might need to improve.
